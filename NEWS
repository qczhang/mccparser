* Version 1.2

Relation (pairing/stacking) constraint added.  Its grammar is:

	 relation :: relation ( <relation definition>+ )
	 relation definition :: <ref> <res> <query>

this constraint will accept a relation only if its properties satisfies the
query.

The library expression is able to read from different input forms: pdb
files, binary files and through socket communication.  See the manual for
syntax.

The explore and restore statements can dump models in different forms: pdb
and binary files or compressed files and through socket communication.  See
the manual for syntax.

Query face operator (/) added in the grammar.  See mcsym NEWS file.

Evaluation of the parser generated structure can now be done via a Visitor
derived from MccVisitor.  The Visitor defines what has to be made for each
tree node.


* Version 1.1

Parser corrected to accept ^M lines terminators.

The parser now includes a interactive interface that can be coupled with
different kind of input buffers.  See documentation for further
explainations.


* Version 1.0

This package contains a parser for Mc-Sym scripts (.mcc).  It is based on
earlier pccts parsers, but this one uses flex and bison for a greater
portability.  The grammar is described in the manual in the docs directory.
